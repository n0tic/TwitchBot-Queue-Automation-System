## The idea
This would be perfect for when you are making gathers or simply was challanged by one of your viewers.
Run the application, set it up and watch the list expand with users who wants to match against or with you.
You control the queue, you control everything.

# TwitchBot Queue & Automation System
This is a twitch bot application which connects to a channel-chat.
It looks for specific command like "!join" and puts the user in the queue list.
It has an easy to understand UI and after setup has been done, start the bot and enjoy.
You can add automated messages to the system too. It will send the message on intervals or on manual send feature.

### Chat commands
> "!cmds", "!cmd" - Shows the commands list.   
> "join", "enter", "queue" - These will put the user who wrote the command in the queue list.   
> "leave", "quit", "exit" - These will remove the user from the queue list.

# Setup steps:
1. (Optional) My recommendation is to create a new twitch account and name it something like "QueueBot". Witty, right?
2. Sign in to the account you want the bot to operate from and request an oAuth key from https://twitchapps.com/tmi/

### NOTE:
You must verify if the bot writes anything to the chat once it has been started. If it doesn't, please verify settings and try again. There is no way to know if the bot was successful.

# Bugs:
There was a crash when I was messing around with starting and stopping the bot as well as adding/deleting automations. I have not been able to replicate this crash so I am unable to fix it. Please report all bugs and crashes! Provide all information you can!
