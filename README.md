# TwitchBot QueueSystem
This is a twitch bot application which connects to a channel-chat.
It looks for specific commands like "!join" and executes commands depending on the chat message.
It has an easy to understand user interface and should be pretty straight forward on how to use.

### Chat commands
> "!cmds", "!cmd" - Shows the commands list.   
> "join", "enter", "queue" - These will put the user who wrote the command in the queue list.   
> "leave", "quit", "exit" - These will remove the user from the queue list.

# Setup steps:
1. (Optional) My recommendation is to create a new twitch account and name it something like "QueueBot". Witty, right?
2. Sign in to the account you want the bot to operate from and request an oAuth key from https://twitchapps.com/tmi/

### NOTE:
You must verify if the bot writes anything to the chat once it has been started. If it doesn't, please verify settings and try again.
